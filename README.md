### English

Tcp2socks implementation by WinDivert.

The project provides a solution to convert tcp connections to socks5.

From 2023.11.29, MapleStory-Japan updated Nexon Game Security(NGS), it had been detecting [Netch](https://github.com/netchx/netch) Process Mode as suspicious activity. Tun Mode can use normally, but Tun mode means all connections have to be proxyed. So I base on WinDivert to design a tcp2socks software.
